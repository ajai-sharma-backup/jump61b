Basically players (red & blue) take turns clicking on squares on an n x n board. 
Everytime you click on a square it's point value increases by one and the color of the square changes to the color of the player that clicked on it.
Once the value of a square reaches it's maximum value (six) the points jump to the surrounding squares and the colors of the surrounding squares change accordingly.

The goal is for one player to own all the squares on the board.
